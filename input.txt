This file contains characters that are encoded with UTF-8.
When recoding this file, the following line works fine, 
because all characters have a position in the target 
character set (ISO 8859-1):

    åäö§ß

The next line, however, contains characters that have no
representation in the target character set (ISO 8859-1),
and iconv will inform about this, aborting after the first
character:

   ῶᾶΦθ

If there's an HTML entity for the character, one can -
manually - convert these characters to such entities.
